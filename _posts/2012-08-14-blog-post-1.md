I just realized how much i have hated changes for the past years of my life and how it has effected me.
I have hated changes because of the sole reasons i was scared of them. New people, new place, new job, new field, new things have always given me second thoughts and I always choose the path which seemed familiar instead of taking a risk. This is wrong. You should be brave and take the responsibility to stand and fight it. Sometimes you will fail but when you will succeed you will see the glory which you have been rewarded with. 
Fight, Rise and Shine!
The world is always open for you, if you are scared today you will not be able to explore it. Be smart not a fool, think wisely and thats it nothing else is required.
