About me
=======
I am an experienced professional with specialized skills in Data Science and Credit Risk Strategy. Since my sophomore year, I have been actively involved in Data Science projects and hackathons.My current work revolves around deriving strategies backed by data to manage and minimize risk for the US Commercial portfolio of American Express.Before this, I have worked with companies in the Pharamaceutical and Marketing businesss-domains.

I am a curious learner and admire creative thinking, in my free time I like to travel,read and capture memories along the journey. I have trekked the Sahyadris(Western Ghats), Sankari Range - Har ki Dun trek and the Brahmatal trek along the family of Bugyals(Meadows) in Uttrakhand. Being outdoors has always helped me rejuvenate and to breakfree from being monotonous. I am competitive and versatile in a few sports with table tennis being at top of my list.

If you need a helping hand or you have an interesting opportunity for me, feel free to reach out and we will take it from there.
