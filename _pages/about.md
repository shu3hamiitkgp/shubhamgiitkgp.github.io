I'm a Data Science professional with three years of experience working in Credit & Fraud Risk division of American Express. Currently I'm pursuing Masters in Information Systems with a focus on Machine learning and Product engineering from Northeastern University in Boston. I have a long term vision to develop products to help businesses digitise unstructured data and build analytics capabilities upon it to drive business growth.     

My most recent work experience revolved around developing data driven strategies to manage and minimize credit risk for the US Commercial portfolio of American Express. Prior to which I have worked with consulting companies in the pharamaceutical and marketing businesss domains.

I am a curious learner and creative thinker, in my free time I like to run, hike, read and capture memories along the journey. I have completed multiple treks in the foothills of Himalayas (Buran Ghati (Altitude - 15K ft), Har ki dun, Brahmatal trek) and across Sahyadris(Western Ghats). Being outdoors has always helped me rejuvenate and to breakfree. I am competitive and versatile in a few sports with table tennis being at top of my list. 

If you need a helping hand or you have an interesting opportunity for me, feel free to reach out and we will take it from there.
