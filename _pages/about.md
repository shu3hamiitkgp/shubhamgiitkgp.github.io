About me
=======
I am an experienced professional with specialized skills in Data Science and Credit Risk Strategy. Currently I'm pursuing MS Information Systems (focus Data Science) from Northeastern University in Boston to upskill myself and develop various projects on the side. My most recent work experience revolved around developing data driven strategies to manage and minimize risk for the US Commercial portfolio of American Express. Prior to which I have worked with consulting companies in the pharamaceutical and marketing businesss domains.

I am a curious learner and admire creative thinking, in my free time I like to travel,read and capture memories along the journey. I have trekked the Sahyadris(Western Ghats), Sankari Range - Har ki Dun trek and the Brahmatal trek along the family of Bugyals(Meadows) in Uttrakhand. Being outdoors has always helped me rejuvenate and to breakfree from being monotonous. I am competitive and versatile in a few sports with table tennis being at top of my list.

If you need a helping hand or you have an interesting opportunity for me, feel free to reach out and we will take it from there.
